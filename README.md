# NYC Bike Sharing
## Overview
Perform analysis on Bike Sharing data from New York City in August 2019 to convince investors that a similar program would be profitable in Des Moines.  Create visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Heat map showing the number of trips by weekday for each hour also broken down by gender.  Each gender has a spike in usage during morning and evening rush hour times with males showing higher usage.

Map showing the number of trips orginating from different locations around the city.  It highlights some locations that more bikes should be made available.
## Summary
Judging by the analysis of the New York data from August, this bike sharing company appears to be a profitable venture.  However, a survey of people in Des Moines would need to be conducted to see if there would be enough desire for this type of venture.  It appears males utilize the service more than females, however, both utilize the service the most during morning and evening rush hour times.  I am not sure how this would scale in a less dense city.  Looking at the bike utilization, it appears it might be beneficial to rotate bikes to reduce the amount of wear.  

One visualization that may be interesting is to see the number of rides of each gender by location.  Another would be the age and gender of each user and where they start from more frequently.
